# Term Paper Topic Selector

This is a web application that allows students to select term paper topics based on diseases and their prevalent countries. The system ensures that no two students can select the same combination of disease and country.

## Features
- Students can select a disease.
- For each disease, the top four prevalent countries are displayed.
- Duplicate selections are prevented.
